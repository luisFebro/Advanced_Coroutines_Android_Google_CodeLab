    // Since we want to keep LiveData in the UI layer for this codelab, we'll use the asLiveData extension function to convert our Flow into a LiveData. Just like the LiveData builder, this adds a configurable timeout to the LiveData generated. This is nice because it keeps us from restarting our query every time the configuration changes (such as from device rotation).
    // StateFlow is different from a regular flow created using, for example, the flow{} builder. A StateFlow is created with an initial value and keeps its state even without being collected and between subsequent collections. You can use the MutableStateFlow interface (as shown above) to change the value (state) of a StateFlow.
    //You will often find that flows that behave like StateFlow are called hot, as opposed to regular, cold flows which only execute when they're collected.
