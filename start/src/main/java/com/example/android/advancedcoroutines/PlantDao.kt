/* NOTES
n1:
By specifying a Flow return type, Room executes the query with the following characteristics:

Main-safety – Queries with a Flow return type always run on the Room executors, so they are always main-safe. You don't need to do anything in your code to make them run off the main thread.
Observes changes – Room automatically observes changes and emits new values to the flow.
Async sequence – Flow emits the entire query result on each change, and it won't introduce any buffers. If you return a Flow<List<T>>, the flow emits a List<T> that contains all rows from the query result. It will execute just like a sequence – emitting one query result at a time and suspending until it is asked for the next one.
Cancellable – When the scope that's collecting these flows is cancelled, Room cancels observing this query.
Put together, this makes Flow a great return type for observing the database from the UI layer.
